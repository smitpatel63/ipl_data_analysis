# 🏏 IPL Match Winning Prediction & Data Analysis Dashboard

### ✨ Project Overview
This project provides a **complete IPL match analysis and winning prediction dashboard** built using **Python** and **Streamlit**.  
It explores historical IPL data using **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly**, and applies **Machine Learning (RandomForestClassifier)** to predict the **winning team** based on match features such as teams, venue, toss, and season.

The goal is to combine **data analytics + predictive modeling** into one interactive, deployable web application.

## 🧩 Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Removed “No Result” matches  
   - Encoded categorical data (teams, venue, toss, etc.)  
   - Created new features like *Bat_First* and *Season*

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Team win distribution  
   - Toss impact on match results  
   - Venue performance heatmaps  
   - Season-wise trends and averages  

3. **Model Building**
   - RandomForestClassifier trained on preprocessed data  
   - Used `train_test_split` with stratification for balanced sampling  
   - Evaluated model accuracy and optimized hyperparameters  

4. **Deployment**
   - Built interactive UI using Streamlit  
   - Deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**
